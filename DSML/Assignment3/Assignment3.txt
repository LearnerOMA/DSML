ASSIGNMENT 3

Problem Statement:
Apply appropriate ML algorithm on a dataset collected in a cosmetics shop showing details of customers to predict customer response for special offer. The cosmetics shop aims to optimize its marketing strategies by predicting customer responses to special offers. 

Objective:
The main objective is to develop a predictive model using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify customers into two categories: likely to respond positively or likely to respond negatively to special offers. By doing so, the shop can target specific customer segments more effectively and improve the efficiency of their marketing campaigns.
To achieve this, we've collected data on their customers, including CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score. The objective is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a customer will respond positively or negatively to special offers based on their demographic and spending characteristics.

S/W Packages and H/W apparatus used:
Software used:
1.	Python 3.10.11
2.	VS Code
Libraries and packages used: NumPy, Pandas

Support Vector Machine(SVM):
	i) Support Vector Machine is one of the most popular supervised algorithm , which used for classification and regression problem . But primarily it is used 	  for classification problem.
	ii) There is plane called Hyperplane used to put new data point in correct category.
	iii) SVM chooses the extreme points/vectors that help in creating the hyperplane. These extreme cases are called as support vectors, and hence algorithm is 
          termed as Support Vector Machine,
	iv) Types of SVM :
		1] Linear SVM :Linear SVM use to linearly seperated data , by using single straight line and such data  called as linearly seperable data and  			   classifier is used  called as Linear SVM classifier.
		2] Non Linear SVm : Non-Linear SVM is used for non-linearly separated data, which means if a dataset cannot be classified by using a straight line, 		   then such data is termed as non-linear data and classifier used is called as Non-linear SVM classifier.
	v) Hyperplane : There can be multiple lines/decision boundaries to segregate the classes in n-dimensional space, but we need to find out the best decision 			boundary that helps to classify the data points. This best boundary is known as the hyperplane of SVM.
	vi) Support Vector : The data points or vectors that are the closest to the hyperplane and which affect the position of the hyperplane are termed as 			             Support Vector. Since these vectors support the hyperplane, hence called a Support vector.
	vii) Working of SVM:
		1]SVM maps the input data into a high-dimensional feature space using a kernel function.
		2]It then finds the hyperplane that best separates the data points of different classes.
		3]The hyperplane is chosen to maximize the margin, which is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points (support vectors) of 		  each 	class.
	
Application:
 	1]Text Categorization: SVM is widely used in text categorization tasks such as spam detection, sentiment analysis, and document classification. It can 		effectively  classify text data into different categories based on features extracted from the text.
  	2]Image Classification: SVM is applied in image classification tasks where it can classify images into different categories such as objects, scenes, or 	characters. It can handle high-dimensional image data and effectively classify images with complex features.
  	3]Customer Behavior Prediction: In the context of the cosmetics shop, SVM can be used to predict customer responses to special offers based on their 		demographic and spending characteristics.

Limitations of SVM:
	1]SVM might not perform well with large datasets as it can be computationally expensive during the training phase.
	2]It may not handle noisy data or data with overlapping classes effectively.
	3]SVM does not directly provide probability estimates, which might be a limitation in some applications where probabilistic outputs are required.



Conclusion:
  In conclusion, SVM is a powerful algorithm for classification tasks and can be effectively used to predict customer responses to special offers based on their      demographic and spending characteristics. However, it's essential to preprocess the data properly, choose appropriate kernel functions, and tune the   
  hyperparameters carefully to achieve the best performance. Additionally, considering the limitations of SVM, it's crucial to assess whether it's the most 
  suitable algorithm for the specific problem at hand.
