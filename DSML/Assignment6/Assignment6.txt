Regression technique

Problem Statement:Download the temperatures dataset from following link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/venky73/temperatures-of-india.
This data consists of temperatures of INDIA averaging the temperatures of all places month-wise.
Temperature values are recorded in CELSIUS.
a) Apply Linear Regression using a suitable library function and predict the Month-wise temperature.
b) Assess the performance of regression models using MSE, MAE and R-Square metrics
c) Visualize a simple regression model.

Objective: This assignment will assist us in understanding the applications of linear regression and how predictions can be made using it.

Theory:

Linear Regression : 
	i) Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear relationship between the dependent variable and one or 	more independent features by fitting a linear equation to observed data.
	ii) Linear Regression can be used to continuously changing values to predict what whould be in future.
	iii) Type of Linear Regression :
		a) Simple Linear Regression : 1] This is the simplest form of linear regression, and it involves only one independent variable and one dependent 						 variable.
 					      2] y = mx + c
		b) Multiple Linear Regression : 1] This involves more than one independent variable and one dependent variable.
						2] y = ax + bx + cx .......... + nx



Applications of Simple Linear Regression:
1.Student grades determined by the number of hours studied (ideally):In this case, exam scores are dependent on the number of hours studied, but the number of hours studied is independent. 

2.Estimating agricultural yields using rainfall data: The measure of precipitation is an independent variable, and yield is a dependent variable. 


3.Estimating an individual's salary based on years of experience: Experience is now the independent variable, and salary is the dependent variable. 

Limitations of Simple Linear Regression: 
1.Assumes linearity: Regression models, particularly linear regression, assume a straight-line relationship between the independent and dependent variables. If the underlying relationship is more complex (curved, exponential, etc.), the model may not accurately capture the true association.

2.	Sensitive to outliers: Outliers (data points significantly different from the majority) can disproportionately influence the regression line, leading to misleading results.

3.	Doesn't establish causation:  Even if a strong correlation is found between variables, regression models cannot determine causality. There might be a third, unseen variable influencing both the independent and dependent variables, creating a false association.


Working:

Linear regression is a fundamental technique in statistics and machine learning used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal is to create a linear model that predicts the dependent variable based on the independent variables.

Here's how a linear regression model works for prediction:

•Importing necessary libraries and modules: They provide pre-built functionalities and extend your program's capabilities

•Data Collection: Collect data on the variables of interest. For example, in a simple linear regression, you would have one independent variable (for eg. Year here) and one dependent variable (for eg. Temperature here).

•Data Preprocessing and EDA: This step involves cleaning the data and analysing it intricately.

•Splitting the Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.

•Model Training: Use the training data to fit a linear regression model. The model tries to find the best-fitting linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. In simple linear regression, this relationship is represented by a line (y = mx + b), where m is the slope and b is the intercept.

•Making Predictions: Once the model is trained, use it to make predictions on the testing data. The model calculates the predicted values of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variable(s).

•Evaluating the Model: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared. These metrics measure how well the model's predictions match the actual values in the testing data.





	









Conclusion:

In summary, a simple linear regression model uses a straight line to determine the association between one independent variable and one dependent variable.
